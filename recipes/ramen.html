        <p>I've been living in Japan for about three years now and have become spoiled by the quality of ramen here. I mean, this is the country where the food comes from, so that makes perfect sense, right?
            This recipe saves you the $1,000+ flight fare so that you can enjoy ramen from the comforts of your home. </p>

        <p>This a Shoyu-style ramen, which means it is soy sauce-based. We added tonkatsu, panko-breaded fried pork, for extra Japanesey-ness. Serves 1.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 and half tsps spicy sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 1x3-inch boneless pork chop slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black sesame seeds, divided</li>
            <li>2 leaves fresh basil, chopped, divided</li>
            <li>1 leaf fresh sage, chopped, divided</li>
            <li>1 3oz package instant ramen noodles, seasoning packet discarded</li>
            <li>1 and 3/4 tablespoons bonito soup stock</li>
            <li>1 and 3/4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon white miso paste with dashi</li>
            <h4>Toppings</h4>
            <li>4 1/3-inch slices Naruto, fish paste stick</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tonkatsu sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sushi ginger, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 green onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain, run cold water over egg, and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Pour sesame oil into a large skillet and lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablesoon olive, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage.
                Flip and cover pork with these remaning ingredients: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.
            </li>
            <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom. This takes about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until the second side is browned as well, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear.
                Return noodles to the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Sitr kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stiring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste is disolved. This takes about 3 to 5 minutes.
                Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut egg in half length-wise. Place egg, pork slices, and Naruto slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, green onion, and black pepper.</li>

            but for us chefs, it means it's finally time to take the grill out of the shed 
            and put it to good use.</p>

        <p>This recipe will teach you how to make the quintessial Summer burger, 
            perfect for Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and any fun day in the sun. Serves 4.</p>

            <li>Shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese</li>

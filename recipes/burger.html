        <h4>A juicy, flavor-filled burger</h4>
        
        <p>Summer is almost around the corner, which can only mean one thing: burgers! Okay, it can mean a couple of different things, 
            but for us chefs, it means it's finally time to take the grill out of the shed 
            and put it to good use.</p>

        <p>This recipe will teach you how to make the quintessial Summer burger, 
            perfect for Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and any fun day in the sun.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lean ground beef</strong>: 1 and half pounds of it.</li>
            <li><strong>Finely chopped white onions</strong>: Your tastebuds will thank you.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar.</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: Envelop these burgers in a mix containing dry onion soup mix, fresh garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, dried parsley, dried basil, dried oregano, crushed dried rosemary, and salt & pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: Increased moisture helps bind the patties together.</li>
            <li><strong>Buns</strong>: Choose your preferred style of bun. I personally go with brioche every time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the beef, onions, seasonings, and eggs in a bowl</li>
            <li>Mix and make four patties</li>
            <li>Set the grill to high heat</li>
            <li>Place the patties on the grill and grill each side for 4-5 minute. You'll know they're done when the juices run clear, they're no longer pink in the center, and an instant-read thermometer reads at least 165 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Place the patties on the buns and add accoutrements to taste</li>
            <li>Enjoy your burger!</li>
        </ol>
